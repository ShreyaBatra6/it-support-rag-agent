# Enterprise IT Support Agentic RAG Copilot

An end-to-end **Forward Deployed Engineer (FDE) project** that turns a notebook-style Agentic RAG workflow into a deployable internal product using **LangGraph, FastAPI, Pinecone, OpenAI, Tavily, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.

---

## 1. Business Problem

### Customer
**NovaRetail**, a fictional 3,000-employee retail company.

### Problem
The internal IT team maintains many documents: VPN instructions, password rules, MFA policy, software installation rules, laptop troubleshooting guides, and service-desk runbooks.

Employees still create repetitive support tickets because:

- They do not know where the correct document is.
- Traditional keyword search returns too many results.
- A normal chatbot may hallucinate an answer.
- Internal documents can be incomplete or outdated.
- Some questions require current vendor information from the public web.

### Example
An employee asks:

> **“How do I connect to the company VPN from home?”**

The answer exists in the private company KB, so the system should **not search the public internet**.

Another employee asks:

> **“What is the latest Microsoft Teams outage guidance?”**

The internal KB may not contain current outage information. The system should recognize weak private evidence, use an external search, grade that evidence, and answer with an external-source warning.

### Business Goal
Build a secure IT Support Copilot that:

1. Searches trusted private knowledge first.
2. Checks whether retrieved evidence is good enough.
3. Uses web search only when private knowledge is insufficient.
4. Rewrites weak queries and retries.
5. Generates grounded answers.
6. Shows the decision path for transparency and debugging.
7. Lets authorized staff add new company documents.

## 2. Why This Is an FDE Project

A Forward Deployed Engineer does more than create an LLM notebook. The FDE must turn the customer's problem into a usable product.

                               ↓
              Still weak after retry → Insufficient Evidence
```

### Why Agentic?

Normal RAG does approximately this:

```text
Question → Retrieve → Generate
```

This project makes decisions:

```text
Question
 → Route
 → Retrieve
 → Evaluate evidence
 → Choose KB or Web
 → Rewrite if needed
 → Retry
 → Generate grounded answer
```

The system therefore controls **what to do next** based on its current state.

## 7. Setup

### Step 1 — Create virtual environment

Requires **Python 3.10 or newer** (3.11 recommended, the same version the Dockerfile uses).

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

On Windows with several Python versions installed, pick 3.11 explicitly: `py -3.11 -m venv venv`.

Windows:

```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```

macOS/Linux:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

### Step 2 — Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 3 — Configure environment

Create a `.env` file in the project root directory with the following variables:

```env
# OpenAI (LLM + embeddings)
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini
EMBEDDING_MODEL=text-embedding-3-small

# External Search
TAVILY_API_KEY=your_tavily_api_key_here

# Vector Database (Pinecone)
PINECONE_API_KEY=your_pinecone_api_key_here
PINECONE_INDEX_NAME=fde-it-support-rag
PINECONE_NAMESPACE=company-it-kb

# Security
ADMIN_API_KEY=change-me-in-production

# Application Settings
APP_ENV=development
```

#### Environment Variable Reference

| Variable | Description | Example | Required |
|---|---|---|---|
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | API key for OpenAI (LLM and embeddings). The account needs billing credit. | `sk-...` | ✅ Yes |
| `TAVILY_API_KEY` | API key for Tavily web search | `tvly-...` | ✅ Yes |
| `PINECONE_API_KEY` | API key for Pinecone vector database | `pcsk_...` | ✅ Yes |
| `PINECONE_INDEX_NAME` | Pinecone index name | `fde-it-support-rag` | ⚠️ Optional (default: `fde-it-support-rag`) |
| `PINECONE_NAMESPACE` | Pinecone namespace for document isolation | `company-it-kb` | ⚠️ Optional (default: `company-it-kb`) |
| `OPENAI_MODEL` | OpenAI chat model used for every LLM step | `gpt-4o-mini` | ⚠️ Optional (default: `gpt-4o-mini`) |
| `EMBEDDING_MODEL` | OpenAI embedding model | `text-embedding-3-small` | ⚠️ Optional (default: `text-embedding-3-small`) |
| `TOP_K` | Number of chunks retrieved from Pinecone per query | `4` | ⚠️ Optional (default: `4`) |
| `MAX_RETRIES` | How many times a weak query is rewritten and retried | `1` | ⚠️ Optional (default: `1`) |
| `ADMIN_API_KEY` | Secret key for admin endpoints (document ingestion) | `your-secure-key` | ⚠️ Optional (default: `change-me`) |
| `APP_ENV` | Application environment | `development` or `production` | ⚠️ Optional (default: `development`) |

**⚠️ Important Security Notes:**

- Never commit `.env` to version control. It is already listed in `.gitignore`.
- Change `ADMIN_API_KEY` to a secure random value in production.
- Use environment variables instead of hardcoding secrets.
- Restrict API key access to only the services that need them.

### Step 4 — Load sample company knowledge

```bash
python ingest_sample_kb.py
```

This demonstrates the RAG ingestion pipeline:

```text
Company Documents
   ↓
Load Documents
   ↓
Chunk Text
   ↓
OpenAI Embeddings
   ↓
Pinecone Vector Database
```

Notes:

- On the first run the Pinecone index is created automatically (1536 dimensions, cosine metric, AWS `us-east-1`, which works on Pinecone's free plan).
- Run this script once. Running it again adds the same chunks a second time.
- If you change `EMBEDDING_MODEL` to one with a different dimension, the existing index is deleted and recreated, and its contents are lost.

### Step 5 — Run the application

```bash
python run.py
```

Open:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8080
```

## 8. Demo Scenarios

### Demo A — Private KB Success

Ask:

> **How do I connect to the company VPN from home?**

Expected path:

```text
Router → KB
Private KB Retrieval
KB Grade → GOOD
Generate from Private KB
```

Why it matters:

> Trusted internal company knowledge is preferred. No public web call is necessary.

---

### Demo B — Company Policy Question

Ask:

> **Can IT support ask me to share my MFA code?**

The internal handbook says employees must never share passwords or MFA codes with support personnel.

Expected path:

```text
Router → KB
Private KB Retrieval
KB Grade → GOOD
Private KB Answer
```

Why it matters:

> RAG allows the model to answer using company-specific information it was never trained on.

---

### Demo C — External / Current Information

Ask:

> **What is the latest Microsoft Teams outage guidance?**

Expected path when internal documents do not answer it:

```text
Router → KB
Private KB Retrieval
KB Grade → WEAK
Tavily Search
Web Grade → GOOD
Web Answer
```

Why it matters:

> Agentic RAG can choose another information source rather than blindly answering from irrelevant vectors.

---

### Demo D — Query Rewrite

Ask a deliberately vague question such as:

> **My work communication app is acting strange after the new update. What should I do?**

If both KB and first external retrieval are weak, the workflow can rewrite the query and retry.

Why it matters:

> Retrieval failure does not immediately mean failure. An agent can improve the search query and try again while using a retry guard to avoid loops.

---

### Demo E — Direct Conversation

Ask:

> **Hello!**

Expected path:

```text
Router → DIRECT
Direct Answer
```

Why it matters:

> Not every message should trigger expensive vector search or web search.

---

## 9. Document Upload Demo

The sidebar contains **Add Company Document**.

Use the `ADMIN_API_KEY` from `.env`.

Upload one of:

- `.pdf`
- `.txt`
- `.md`
- `.docx`

The backend performs:

```text
Upload
  ↓
Validate Type
  ↓
Load Text
  ↓
Recursive Chunking
  ↓
Embeddings
  ↓
Pinecone Indexing
  ↓
Immediately Available for Retrieval
```

This is useful in an FDE demonstration because the customer does not want to edit Python every time a new policy is published.

---

## 10. API Endpoints

### `GET /api/health`

Health check.

### `POST /api/chat`

Request:

```json
{
  "question": "How do I reset my company password?"
}
```

Response contains:

```json
{
  "answer": "...",
  "source_used": "private_kb",
  "trace": [
    "Router → KB",
    "Private KB retrieval → 4 chunks",
    "KB evidence grade → GOOD",
    "Answer generation → PRIVATE KB"
  ],
  "citations": [
    {"title": "company_it_handbook.md", "url": "", "type": "private_kb"}
  ],
  "rewritten_query": "How do I reset my company password?"
}
```

`source_used` is one of `private_kb`, `web_search`, `direct` or `insufficient_evidence`. `rewritten_query` equals the original question unless the agent rewrote it.

### `POST /api/ingest`

Protected by the `X-Admin-Key` request header.

Uploads a document (`multipart/form-data`, field name `file`) and adds its chunks to Pinecone.

Response:

```json
{
  "message": "Document indexed",
  "file": "vpn_policy.pdf",
  "chunks": 3,
  "ids_created": 3
}
```
